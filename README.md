# A RPG Game made with Javascript (and soon Typescript)

## Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures 
URL: [From the course in freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)

This is the free course available in freecodecamp. In this course you can build a simple RPG Game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND IMPROVE IT!

### HTML

There is not much room to improve the HTML file, but I have changed the abusive use of the div tags and instead use more semantic HTML tags. More changes will come soon.

### CSS

I added the use of variables for the colors to make future changes easier and changed some styles, more will be done soon.

### Javascript

Still not completed, but when it's done, the idea is to modularize the Javascript in separate files and then use Typescript.
